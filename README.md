"Moonridge" (working title) is a real-time tactical RPG with strong farming and crafting sim elements and a strong roguelike influence.

It is currently in the very early stages of development, with many core systems either still unfinished or not implemented.

Here is a very rough description of the planned gameplay:

* A real-time tactical combat system slightly reminiscent of the Infinity System (Baldur's Gate).
* Stylistically inspired by many older rpgs, especially in the Final Fantasy and Zelda series.
* One player character, but the ability to indirectly manage a party, as well as "followers" (non-combat but loyal npcs).
* A farming and crafting system that will feature a large variety of crops as well as a deep crop quality system.
* The solar/seasonal/celestial calendar has a major influence over the game, including crafting.
* Religion and spiritual worship will have a major influence over the game, including crafting.
* A deep, crafting-based equipment customization system.
* A procedurally generated world that will feature a diverse wilderness environment, villages, caves, dungeons, ruins, temples, homesteads and more.
* Procedurally generated NPCs who will be capable of a variety of tasks to maintain their home/environment.
* A variety of enemies with unique behaviors and desires. Advanced enemies will have cultures and can sometimes be reasoned with.
