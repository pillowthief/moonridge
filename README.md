# moonridge
"Moonridge" (working title) is a real-time tactical RPG with strong farming and crafting sim elements and a strong roguelike influence.

It is currently in the very early stages of development, with many core systems either still unfinished or not implemented. However, every build I push to the master should compile, so feel free to try it. Requires Love2D to run.
