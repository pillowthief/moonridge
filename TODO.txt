FIX LOAD IN GENERAL make player inherit old facing on load game

minimap

make the player not care what chunk they're in, camera not care, just render what's around

make sure chunks are saving their data correctly on player exit (maybe so?)

overworld-gen
  underground generate filled ground, caves, tombs,

savegame management screen (no file)
  save worlds, load worlds, independent of chars

consider if the Atlas should store time

add concept of Pause to gamescreen

tile transitions

add the concept of the Cursor

create own entity component system, get rid of the lib
  entities contain tables of traits, functions to parse this shit

add descriptions to glyphs
  make the look tab work
  +quicklook via a keyboard command (quicklooks everything 'important' on screen)
  +quicklook via mouse

mouse support

make the calendar tab useful
  make calendar cycles more interesting (moon cycles, etc)

create a DAY shader and a NIGHT shader
  day shader cycles through tints, night shader does the same but accounts for lights

create a INDOORS/CAVE shader
  simpler version of the NIGHT shader

universal color palette(unlikely)

implement a combat system

implement a lib for controllers(maybe)

use the calendar as a scheduler

inventory management

items
  make them, also allow other things to have the concept of "inventory"

objects
  make them

map-utils.Lua
  optimize via the updateGlyphs function

cheatmenu (no file)
  add a debugging cheat menu

crafting screen

time-passage storage/simulation
  when the player leaves an area start a clock
  after a certain amount of real-time (maybe 5 minutes, maybe more) the clock stops
  before the clock stops, if player comes back game quickly passes that much time
  after clock stops, game passes a less specific "randomize based on time-passed" upon player return
    time passed is "short","medium","long","very long" and will effect certain types of content change
    randomized change will still be made aware of factors like current time of day

travellers
  travellers will be npcs (and possibly other things like seeds) that can change maps, and therefore need
  to be checked at times when the player isn't around

procedural dialogue generation
  create a dialogue parser that can read an easy to write filesystem
  create functions that can randomly generate aspects of the dialogue
  create a procedural dialogue tree building system
