time-passage storage/simulation
  when the player leaves an area start a clock
  after a certain amount of real-time (maybe 5 minutes, maybe more) the clock stops
  before the clock stops, if player comes back game quickly passes that much time
  after clock stops, game passes a less specific "randomize based on time-passed" upon player return
    time passed is "short","medium","long","very long" and will effect certain types of content change
    randomized change will still be made aware of factors like current time of day
